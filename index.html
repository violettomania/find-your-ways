                    history of
                    the Hungarian Jews is intriguing. And it's all condensed in Budapest’s 7th district.
                    In the past 200 years the Hungarian Jews were privileged enough to be able to build Europe's largest
                    synagogue and damned enough that 80%
                    of them was killed during WW2. Today the Jewish district is a thriving cultural hub again. What's
                    going
                    on here? This is what we explore.
                    <br> <br>Half ways down the tour we stop for a coffee and ‘flódni’ - a traditional Hungarian-Jewish
                    cake.

                    Ruins of ancient Roman provincial capital Aquincum is still attractive. Its invaluable findings eg a
                    1800 years old organ and the reconstructed buildings of a shrine of Mithras with
                    the painter's house introduce you to the everyday life, fears and beliefs of the Romans. This tour

                    Thanks to a bunch of youngsters in the 70's who ventured to remote corners of the Carpathian basin
                    to
                    collect and save the heritage of a disappearing traditional lifestyle.
                    They mastered the techniques and brought it back to the city. The young urban guys are grey-haired
                    university professors and teachers now.
                    The old dancers, singers, musicians and craftsmen are long gone, but their heritage is passed on. A
                    folk
                    revival was born. Today it is more vivid than ever. The most tactile tour in town.

                    press. Is he a threat or a new hope for Europe? Which one is he? Neither? Both?
                    You can decide once you see the big picture. One thing is for sure. He's been in business for 30
                    years.
                    Through his story you can learn a lot from Hungary and the Hungarians. Not only that, but it also
                    sheds
                    a light on the conflicts and successes Central Europe has gone through.

                    judging,
